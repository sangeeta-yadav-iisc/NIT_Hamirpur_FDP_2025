# Workshop “Infectious Disease Dynamics: Modeling and Computational Techniques”
Venue: BITS Pilani K. K. Birla Goa Campus

# Hands-on Session on PINNs and DeepXDE

- [Python programming fundamentals](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/BITS_GOA_2025_workshop/blob/main/pythontutorial1.ipynb)
- PyTorch: tensors, automatic differentiation, neural networks
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using DeepXDE
- Solving PDEs without traditional meshing

I will demonstrate the use of **DeepXDE** for solving following excercises with corresponding notebooks:

- [1D Steady Convection–Diffusion Equation](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/NIT_Hamirpur_FDP_2025/blob/main/convdiff.ipynb)

- [Analytical vs PINN derivatives](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/NIT_Hamirpur_FDP_2025/blob/main/derivatives.ipynb)

- [1D Time-Dependent Burgers’ Equation](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/NIT_Hamirpur_FDP_2025/blob/main/burgers_equation.ipynb)

**Key Concepts**
- Automatic differentiation for PDE derivatives
- Embedding physical laws into neural networks
- Enforcing governing equations as soft constraints
- Data-driven and physics-informed modeling
