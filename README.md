# L30: Neural Network–based Solvers for Convection–Diffusion Systems

I demonstrate the use of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with **DeepXDE** for solving following equations with corresponding notebooks:

- [1D Steady Convection–Diffusion Equation](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/NIT_Hamirpur_FDP_2025/blob/main/convdiff.ipynb)

- [1D Time-Dependent Burgers’ Equation](https://github.com/sangeeta-yadav-iisc/NIT_Hamirpur_FDP_2025/blob/main/burgers_equation.ipynb)


## Methodology

- A fully connected neural network approximates the solution $$u(x)$$
- PDE residuals are enforced via **automatic differentiation**
- Boundary conditions are imposed through the loss function
- No mesh or numerical discretization is required

## What this notebook demonstrates

- Construction of a PINN using PyTorch
- Enforcement of physics constraints
- Solving convection-dominated problems
- Visualization of boundary-layer behavior
